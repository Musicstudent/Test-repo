This file is now in the development branch to experiment with it.

This is a simple text file for getting to know git and github.
With an added sentence to make a second commit.
I would like to add some other content now:
This is a senctence to create a conflict with the test branch.
blah blah blah, I can't make up anything that makes sense.
